### Setup

+ `npm install`

#### How to initialize/run your application (where applicable)

+ e.g. `npm start`

#### Features / Routes

+ Simple, intuitive user interface
  + A form where a user:
    + Enters a REST API Endpoint (URI)
    + Selects the REST Method to use (`get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`)
    + For `put` and `post`, allow the user to enter JSON to be used as the body for the request
    + A button to initiate the request
  + An output section which:
    + Displays a spinner to indicate a request is in process
    + Once a request is complete:
      + Hide the spinner
      + Display a well formatted view of the API response in 2 sections
        + Headers
        + Body
  + A history section which:
    + Shows a list of all unique, successful requests
    + Allows a user to click or select one to re-populate the form so they can repeat the request

#### Tests

+ `npm test`
+ Footer.test.jsx
  + displays footer text as expected

+ Header.test.jsx
  + displays h1 text as expected

+ Form.test.jsx
  + grabs url and method input as expected

+ App.test.jsx
  + allows form use and renders results as expected
